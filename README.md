# Facial Keypoint Detection

In this project, will combine knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build an end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. 

### Project Components

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in one Python notebook:

Part 1: Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial keypoints on any image!

### Tasks

Part 1 : Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

- Step 0: Detect Faces Using a Haar Cascade Classifier
- Step 1: Add Eye Detection
- Step 2: De-noise an Image for Better Face Detection
- Step 3: Blur an Image and Perform Edge Detection
- Step 4: Automatically Hide the Identity of an Individual

Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

- Step 5: Create a CNN to Recognize Facial Keypoints
- Step 6: Compile and Train the Model
- Step 7: Visualize the Loss and Answer Questions

Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial keypoints on any image!

- Step 8: Build a Robust Facial Keypoints Detector (Complete the CV Pipeline)
